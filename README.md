# Custom form validation using HTML, CSS and JavaScript


Here I have created a custom form validation using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, without the use of existing validation like the use of required attribute.
Here I have used regular expressions of javascript to ensure we have proper email entered as well and also I consoled the value of the user entered name , mailId and password.
